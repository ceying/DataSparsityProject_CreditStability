# Data Sparsity Project
This project is set up to examine and correct the effect of data sparsity in credit models, particularly, how model performance differs for individuals with different levels of financial information on file at the time of the loan application.
Three STO policies are introduced and examined, with objectives on balancing 1. minimizing performance gaps between the groups, and 2. maximizing group performance.

The following steps are included:
1.  Data loading & preprocessing
2.  Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning using Optuna
3.  Run models with the best parameters from Step 2
4.  Performance analysis between groups with statistical tests
5.  STO policies analysis
6.  STO financial cost analysis
